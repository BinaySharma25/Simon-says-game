# Simon-says-game
 Built a Simon Says Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
 The game challenges players to repeat an ever-growing sequence of button presses — with audio and visual feedback to enhance the experience.

 • Generates random color patterns each round
 • Highlights buttons with sound and animation
 • Tracks user input and level progression
 • Responsive UI for desktop and mobile

 This project helped me practice event handling, arrays, game logic, and working with audio elements — all in vanilla JavaScript.
